A derivation library for scala 3 with annotation based configuration.

## Usage

This library os being published to the macen central. Add library to your project as

```sbt
libraryDependencies += "com.evolution" %% "derivation-circe" % "{version}"
```

Finally, define your own type, which derives circe instances


```scala
import evo.derivation.*
import evo.derivation.circe.*
import evo.derivation.config.Config
import java.util.UUID

@SnakeCase
@Discriminator("type")
enum User derives Config, EvoCodec:
    case AuthorizedClient(@Rename("client_id") id: UUID, name: String)
    case Anonymous
```


## Annotation reference

### `@SnakeCase`
 Transforms all the constructor and\or field names to the snake case

### `@Discriminator(name: String)`
 Defines discriminator field for serialization of `sealed trait` or `enum`

### `@Rename(name: String)`

 Renames single `case class` field or `enum` constructor

### `@Embed`
Write\Reads all inner fields of some field on the upper level during serialization
